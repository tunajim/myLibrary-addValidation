# myLibrary-addValidation

Use Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create a library application that keeps tracks of books you have and have not read.
It is the second iteration of my previous [library](https://tunajim.github.io/myLibrary) app except with custom form validation.  

This is the new [library](https://tunajim.github.io/myLibrary-addValidation).
